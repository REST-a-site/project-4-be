## Motivation:
Restaurants and bars in the industry often outsource the building of their websites to third party services. With outsourcing comes the less than stellar access to update their seasonally changing menu or 86 items for which they no longer have inventory to make. Giving control back to restaurant operators is the central motivation of 921Steak. 921Steak is a full stack application using React, Django, and Python to create a beautiful looking single page website.
